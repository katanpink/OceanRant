        <p>The oceans are a viatal part of the earth and is a reagion that leads new discorveries and techniques, without the ocean we would never have learned deep net fishing, we would have never studied the stars or even wondered about the great above, without the ocean we wouldn't have great explorers traveling new lands and setting new histroy for humanity. The ocean Feels as if it's a biome in a video game and as we explore it more we unlock new more innovative inventions. Like for example, when exploring the depths of the ocean the pressure to too high for humans to travel down there, so we created drones and cameras to dig deeper. New animals and species wait down in the depths of the ocean like luminescent shrimp that increased creativity of humans.</p>

        <p>The ocean and aquas, a very large expanse of sea, in particular each of the main areas into which the sea is divided geographically. Forever bordering the coast lines of the land we dwell in. The ocean is somewhat of a whole different world from the one we live in. The creatures that inhabit the seas and aquas have unique biographies, shapes, and colors way more unique than the animals you would encounter on the land. The seas are a seemingly endless from the human eye with nothing but the blue water reflecting into the sky. Why is the Ocean so important?</p>
